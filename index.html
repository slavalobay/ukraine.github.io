“Carol of the Bells” is a Ukrainian folk song 
One of the most famous Christmas songs “Schedryk” (a folk song written by a Ukrainian composer, Mykola Leontovich) is known to the rest of the world as “Carol of the Bells” or “Ring Christmas Bells”. Based on an old Ukrainian folk song, the original lyrics describe a swallow flying into a household to proclaim the plentiful year that the family will have. The song's title is derived from the Ukrainian word "shchedryi" which means "bountiful." The folk melody was sung in many Ukrainian villages. 
The song has been used many times in the soundtracks for films and television.	
Ukraine is geographic center of Europe
